# __error is now a REAL function (kernel.c) — it forwards to libkernel's __error
# once initKernel() has resolved it, and returns a private fallback slot before
# then.  So it is always safe to call directly here.  (The old libPS4 exposed
# __error as a function-POINTER variable, hence the original `call __error[rip]`;
# that indirection is wrong now and would jump through the first 8 bytes of the
# function's machine code -> garbage control flow.)
